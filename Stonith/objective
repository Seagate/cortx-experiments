## Create two level stonith

  - First level sbd and second level ipmi fencing
  - Try sbd with self fencing and opposite fencing node.

## Test
  ```
    pcs stonith disable stonith-c1
    pcs stonith disable stonith-c2

    # Bring down eth for srvnode-2
    ip link set down f1
  ```

## Result:
  - Level 1 sbd and 2 ipmi
    - Both Running ipmi, sbd and fencing happen
      - sbd shutdown faulty node node
    - ipmi failed but sbd running
      - sbd shutdown faulty node node
    - sbd failed but ipmi running
      - failed node will poweroff by ipmi
    - IF sbd configure to fence other node
      - If resource fail to stop on single node then IEM may reach to csm but node will not get fence.
    - IF sbd configure to fence self node
      - If resource fail to stop on single node then single node will get off.

## Drawback
  - Replace node may need to restart cluster to enable sbd
