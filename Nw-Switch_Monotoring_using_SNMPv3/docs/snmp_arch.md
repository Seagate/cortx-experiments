## SNMP Architechture
In typical uses of SNMP, one or more administrative computers called managers have the task of monitoring or managing a group of hosts or devices on a computer network. Each managed system executes a software component called an agent which reports information via SNMP to the manager.

SNMP-managed network consists of three key components:
* Managed devices   - any networking device like router, switch, hub, power supply unit, etc.
* Agent – software which runs on managed devices
* Network management station (NMS) – software that runs on the manager
